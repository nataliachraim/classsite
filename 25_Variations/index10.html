<h1>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (Daffodils)</h1>
    <br>
<p>I wandered lonely as a <h1>cloud</h1>
    <br>
That floats on high o'er <h5>vales and hills,</h5>
    <br>
When all at once I saw a <h4>crowd,</h4>
    <br>
A host, of golden daffodils; 
    <br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
    <br>
<h1>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
Continuous as the stars that shine
    <br>
And twinkle on the milky way,
    <br>
<h3>They stretched in never-ending line</h3>
    <br>
Along the margin of a bay:
    <br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
    <br>
<h2>Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
The waves beside them danced; but they
    <br>
<h6>Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:</h6>
    <br>
A poet could not but be gay,
    <br>
In such a jocund company:
    <br>
I gazed- and gazed- but little thought
    <br>
<h4>What wealth the show to me had brought:</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie
    <br>
<h2>In vacant or in pensive mood,</h2>
    <br>
They flash upon that inward eye
    <br>
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
    <br>
<h5>And then my heart with pleasure fills,</h5>
    <br>
<h1>And dances with the daffodils.</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    William Wordsworth

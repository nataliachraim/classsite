<h1>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (Daffodils)</h1>
    <br>
<p style="serif">I wandered lonely as a cloud
    <br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
    <br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,
    <br>
A host, of golden daffodils; 
    <br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
    <br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
    <br>
    <br>
Continuous as the stars that shine
    <br>
And twinkle on the milky way,
    <br>
They stretched in never-ending line
    <br>
Along the margin of a bay:
    <br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
    <br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
    <br>
    <br>
The waves beside them danced; but they
    <br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
    <br>
A poet could not but be gay,
    <br>
In such a jocund company:
    <br>
I gazed- and gazed- but little thought
    <br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:
    <br>
    <br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie
    <br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,
    <br>
They flash upon that inward eye
    <br>
Which is the bliss of solitude; 
    <br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
    <br>
And dances with the daffodils. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    William Wordsworth
